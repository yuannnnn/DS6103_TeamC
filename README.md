## Topic: Worldwide COVID-19 Cases Analysis

### Research Topic

We'd like to study on worldwide COVID-19 cases, one of the most influential topics of the current year, claiming many lives, and drastically changing how we live.  For another project, we've already analyzed how poverty levels and sanitary facilities be impacted by the virus, and if diabetes, smoking habit, or handwashing alone could affect the COVID-19 infection rate and death rate. Also, we foud there's no relationships between population density and confirmed cases. However, we still have plenty questions about such date, so we continually working on it.

### Source of Datasets and Observations
The data we have is from [GitHub](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv), which is produced by [*Our World in Data*](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). The data set has 55893 observations of 49 variables, with covid-19 information of 215 countries, including total confirmed cases, total deaths, total tests, positive rates, Government Response Stringency Index, age levels, etc. 

### SMART Questions
1. Which countries are making progress against the pandemic? Due to case counts are only meaningful if we also know how much testing a country does, what are the rate of positive tests of them?
2. If higher Government Response Stringency Index level can cause lower confirmed cases?
3. If the hospital conditions (beds per 1,000 people, weekly icu admissions per million, and weekly hosp admissions million) have relationships with death rates?
4. For what age levels, they have the most confirmed cases, as well as deaths? Is that for specific continent, country, or for most of the world?
